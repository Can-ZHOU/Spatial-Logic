In this file, reasoners and rules as well as test data have been put into folder "test_V1"

The results compared with previous version have been put into folder "results"

reasoner can be runned by command pop11 new_LD_reasoner

all alters have been listen in file "new_LD_rules_EW_v0_1" and "new_LD_rules_NS_v0_1" and able to be checked

The approxmiate effeciency improved 50%, but I don't think is the last version, maybe more rules can be replaced.
