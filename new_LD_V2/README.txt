In this file, reasoners and rules as well as test data have been put into folder "test_V1"

The results compared with previous version have been put into folder "results"

reasoner can be runned by command pop11 new_LD_reasoner

all alters have been listen in file "new_LD_rules_EW_v0_1" and "new_LD_rules_NS_v0_1" and able to be checked

The approxmiate effeciency improved 50%, but I don't think is the last version, maybe more rules can be replaced.


newly added:
1. all rules I deleted are titled with new_deleted they can easily checked by searching.

2. I also released the last rule in AS12 this rule imitates all W & E rules.

3. as for the nott.txt and south.txt data the processing speed accelerated approximately 50%
but for nott_ew2.txt and south.ew2.txt data the processing speed only accelerated 25% percent, I did't figured out this phenomeon yet.....

4. all related file I have added into the folder as well as the testing data, The data name have been listed in file: "new_LD_reasoner" they can be processed by changing the "vars poparglist".

5. Good luck ^ ^
