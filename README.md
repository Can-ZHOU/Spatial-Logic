### Code & Data for Paper: (Accepted by Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research) 
## A Logic of Directions and its Finite Axiomatisability over 2D Euclidean Space

### Set Up && Environment
- Running environment: Ubuntu 18.04
- Programming environment: Poplog (can be downloaded via [this link](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html))

### Run Code
- To run the LD2 reasoner: 
    - `` pop11 t=2/new_LD_reasoner_v0_1.p``
- To run the LD3 reasoner:
     - `` pop11 t=3/new_LD_reasoner_v0_1.p``
- To compare nogoods generated by LD2 and LD3 reasoners:
  - ``python3 compare/compare.py``
